# SE 303 Final Exam (Part 2)

This is the programming portion of the SE 303 final exam. There are a number of
subdirectories in this repo, each with production code in _lib_ and test code in
_test_. The code within _lib_ contains at least one smell. Your goal is to
refactor the code in _lib_ while keeping the test suite passing.

Proceed alphabetically: try refactoring the code in the _apple_ directory first.
Then try _banana_, and so on.

The instructor will run your tests, which should remain unmodified.

Please, do not leave comments describing your incomplete intent, "out of time,"
commented code, etc. Let your code speak for itself.
